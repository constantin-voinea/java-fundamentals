 * A thread can be in one of the following states:
 * NEW - A thread that has not yet started
 * RUNNABLE - A thread executing in the Java virtual machine
 * BLOCKED - A thread that is blocked waiting for a monitor lock; can run again when key is released
 * WAITING - A thread that is waiting indefinitely for another thread to perform a particular action; can run again when notify() is called
 * TIMED_WAITING -  A thread that is waiting for another thread to perform an action for up to a specified waiting time
 * TERMINATED - A thread that has exited
 * A thread can be in only one state at a given point in time. These states are virtual machine states which do not reflect any operating system thread states.
