 * implementing Runnable functional interface
 * might be the preferred solution to work with threads
 * - if defining a class that implements Runnable, that class can also extend another class
 * - decouple implementation (contract through interface) from execution (actual thread) -> composition over inheritance
 * - easy to queue runnables to be executed by a thread pool
